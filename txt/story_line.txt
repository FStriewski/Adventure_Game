#Fluff Text used for the story
{SL01}It's been a long day. Ever since you started your trip three days ago, to visit a client up north, you hadn't had much sleep or rest. Now, driving down this godforsaken road in the middle of nowwhere, you really feel the exhaustion. It must have been your tiredness or the urgent wish to be back home before dark that made you take what you thought would be a shortcut. But the road, small at it is goes on and on through the woods and you don't know when you passed the last village. You are pushing down the pedal as hard as you can, to make up for it and the your old car slingers on the rain beaten road through the dark woods. Just as you thought you saw some lights in the distance, not too far down the hill probably, the motor stutters and your car comes to an abrupt hold. Shit! Seems like you run out of gas...
{SL02}With a torchlight in your right and a cannister for gas in your left you follow the road. It is still raining and by now it is dark. The lights you saw were no illusion but seem to come from a manor further down the hill. You open the big metal gate and slip inside a big courtyard that leads to a flight of steps. Noone is around. You knock, you shout, nothing. Out of desperation you try to open the front door..it is unlocked! You slip inside...
